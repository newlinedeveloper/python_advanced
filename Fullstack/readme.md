ðŸš— Project: Vehicle Configuration and Simulation Platform

ðŸ“Œ Description:
Led the development of a fullstack platform for configuring, integrating, simulating, and testing virtual vehicle architectures. The platform enables automotive engineers to define a vehicle model, assign individual components (e.g., ECUs, sensors, actuators), configure parameters, simulate interactions, and validate functionality through test casesâ€”entirely through a web interface.

âœ… Key Features:

1. Vehicle Modeling and Configuration

* Engineers can create a digital twin of a vehicle by defining high-level vehicle attributes (e.g., model, variant, year).
* Component hierarchy (Engine ECU, Brake Controller, BMS, etc.) is mapped and stored using relational and document-based structures.
* Each component supports customizable configuration data, such as communication interfaces, software versions, calibration values, etc.

2. Component Integration Workflow

* Components can be virtually wired to one another to simulate real-world signal/data flows.
* Dependency validation logic ensures compatibility between integrated components.
* Integration logic supports dynamic component replacement and interface updates.

3. Simulation and Testing Environment

* Allows simulation of system behavior with configurable input signals.
* Engineers can define and execute test cases to verify expected behavior (e.g., signal propagation, error state transitions).
* Provides runtime logs, status reports, and test result dashboards.

4. Access Control and Collaboration

* Role-based access for architects, developers, and testers.
* Audit trail and versioning support for tracking configuration changes and test results.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

* Frontend: React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL (component data), MongoDB (config snapshots)
* DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch)
* Simulation Engine: Python modules for signal simulation and data injection
* API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI

ðŸ“ˆ Impact:

* Streamlined vehicle configuration and test workflows, reducing setup time by 60%
* Enabled faster prototyping and validation cycles for new vehicle architectures
* Improved cross-team collaboration by centralizing vehicle knowledge and test history
* Reduced physical test rig dependency by enabling virtual testing environments

Let me know if you'd like this added to your resume under the Projects section or integrated into your professional experience. I can also tailor the phrasing to emphasize either backend, frontend, or cloud skills.
