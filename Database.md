Let's dive into **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases, focusing on **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **MongoDB**. We'll cover optimizing queries, schema design, transaction management, and indexing with examples.

### **SQL Databases (PostgreSQL and MySQL)**

SQL databases are relational and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They are suitable for applications that require multi-row transactions and complex queries.

#### **1. PostgreSQL and MySQL**
Both are relational databases, but PostgreSQL is known for its advanced features like full-text search, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards, while MySQL is popular for web applications and easy-to-use nature.

##### **Schema Design**
- **Tables** with defined columns (data types, constraints).
- **Relationships** using foreign keys.

**Example (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    product VARCHAR(100),
    order_date DATE
);
```

##### **Query Optimization**
- Use **indexes** to speed up SELECT queries.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`; instead, specify needed columns.
- Use **JOINs** efficiently.
- **Analyze and optimize** with tools like `EXPLAIN` in PostgreSQL or MySQL.

**Example (Using Index and Explain)**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON orders(user_id);

-- Optimize query
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 1;
```

##### **Transaction Management**
- Transactions ensure data integrity using ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- Use `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to manage transactions.

**Example**:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product, order_date) VALUES (1, 'Laptop', '2024-12-30');
COMMIT;
```

### **NoSQL Database (MongoDB)**

NoSQL databases like MongoDB are non-relational and can store unstructured data in documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. They are ideal for applications requiring flexibility and scalability.

#### **1. MongoDB**
MongoDB stores data in **JSON-like documents** and is schema-less, allowing for a flexible structure.

##### **Schema Design**
- **Collections** instead of tables.
- **Documents** instead of rows, with key-value pairs.

**Example (MongoDB Schema)**:
```json
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "orders": [
        {
            "product": "Laptop",
            "order_date": "2024-12-30"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### **Query Optimization**
- Use **indexes** to improve query performance.
- Use **aggregation** for complex queries.

**Example (Indexing and Aggregation)**:
```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 });

db.orders.aggregate([
    { $match: { user_id: 1 } },
    { $group: { _id: "$product", total: { $sum: 1 } } }
]);
```

##### **Transaction Management**
MongoDB supports multi-document transactions for operations that need to adhere to ACID properties.

**Example (Transaction)**:
```javascript
const session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();
try {
    db.users.insertOne({ "username": "john_doe", "email": "john@example.com" }, { session });
    db.orders.insertOne({ "user_id": 1, "product": "Laptop", "order_date": new Date() }, { session });
    session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
    session.abortTransaction();
}
```

### **Indexing**
- SQL: Create indexes on frequently queried columns.
- NoSQL: Index fields used in queries and aggregation pipelines.

**Example (SQL Index)**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
```

**Example (MongoDB Index)**:
```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 });
```

### **Summary**

- **SQL Databases** (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Structured data, relationships, complex queries, and strict schema.
- **NoSQL Databases** (MongoDB): Flexible schema, unstructured data, scalability, and suitable for hierarchical or graph-like data structures.
- **Optimization**: Use indexing, avoid expensive operations, and optimize query plans.
- **Transactions**: Essential for maintaining data integrity in multi-step operations.

### **Implementing Full-Text Search in PostgreSQL** ðŸš€

PostgreSQL provides **built-in full-text search capabilities** using `tsvector` and `tsquery`. Full-text search is useful for searching large text-based datasets efficiently.

---

## **1. Basic Concepts**
### ðŸ”¹ `tsvector`
- Converts text into a search-friendly format (normalized & tokenized).
- Stores words in a sorted, indexed structure.

### ðŸ”¹ `tsquery`
- Used for searching inside `tsvector` data.

### ðŸ”¹ `to_tsvector(text)`
- Converts a text column into a `tsvector`.

### ðŸ”¹ `to_tsquery(query)`
- Converts a search string into a `tsquery`.

### ðŸ”¹ `@@`
- Match operator to compare `tsvector` with `tsquery`.

---

## **2. Basic Example**
```sql
SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'PostgreSQL has full text search') @@ to_tsquery('full & text');
```
âœ… **Returns `true`** because both "full" and "text" exist in the document.

---

## **3. Implementing Full-Text Search in a Table**
### **Step 1: Create a Sample Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    search_vector tsvector
);
```

---

### **Step 2: Populate Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO articles (title, content)
VALUES 
('PostgreSQL Full Text Search', 'Learn how to implement full text search in PostgreSQL'),
('Introduction to Databases', 'This article explains relational databases and NoSQL'),
('Full Text Search Optimization', 'Techniques to optimize text search performance');
```

---

### **Step 3: Create a `tsvector` Column**
```sql
UPDATE articles 
SET search_vector = to_tsvector(title || ' ' || content);
```

---

### **Step 4: Perform Search**
```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('text & search');
```
âœ… **Finds rows where both "text" and "search" exist.**

---

## **4. Optimizing with Indexing**
### **Create a GIN Index for Fast Search**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_search ON articles USING GIN(search_vector);
```
**Why?**  
ðŸ”¹ `GIN` (Generalized Inverted Index) speeds up full-text search significantly.  
ðŸ”¹ Queries become **much faster** with large datasets.

---

## **5. Ranking Search Results**
### **Use `ts_rank()` to Rank Results**
```sql
SELECT id, title, ts_rank(search_vector, to_tsquery('text & search')) AS rank
FROM articles
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('text & search')
ORDER BY rank DESC;
```
âœ… Higher-ranked results appear first.

---

## **6. Using `plainto_tsquery()` for User-Friendly Search**
Instead of manually adding `&` operators:
```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE search_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('full text search');
```
âœ… Automatically converts user input into a `tsquery`.

---

## **7. Dynamic Updates with Triggers**
Instead of manually updating `search_vector`, use a **trigger**:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION update_search_vector() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.search_vector = to_tsvector(NEW.title || ' ' || NEW.content);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_articles_search
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON articles
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_search_vector();
```
âœ… Keeps `search_vector` updated on every insert/update.

---

## **8. Using Full-Text Search with Django & PostgreSQL**
If you're using **Django with PostgreSQL**, use `SearchVector`:
```python
from django.contrib.postgres.search import SearchVector
from myapp.models import Article

# Full-Text Search Query
Article.objects.annotate(search=SearchVector('title', 'content')).filter(search='text search')
```
âœ… **Built-in Django support** for full-text search.

---

## **9. When to Use PostgreSQL Full-Text Search?**
âœ… You need **fast search within structured text data**.  
âœ… You want **advanced ranking & indexing** for better performance.  
âœ… You prefer **built-in support** instead of using external search engines like Elasticsearch.  

---

### **ðŸ”¥ Final Thoughts**
- PostgreSQL **full-text search** is **powerful, scalable, and built-in**.
- Use **GIN indexes** for better performance.
- Use **triggers** to keep search vectors updated.
- Use `ts_rank()` for **ranking search results**.
