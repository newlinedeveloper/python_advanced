### üìù **Sample Practice Questions**

To aid your preparation, here are some sample questions that reflect the style and content of the IKM Python 3 assessment:

1. **What is the output of the following code?**

   ```python
   def func(a, L=[]):
       L.append(a)
       return L

   print(func(1))
   print(func(2))
   print(func(3))
   ```



* A) \[1] \[2] \[3]
* B) \[1] \[1, 2] \[1, 2, 3]
* C) \[1] \[1] \[1]
* D) Error

**Answer**: B) \[1] \[1, 2] \[1, 2, 3]

**Explanation**: Default mutable arguments retain changes between function calls.

2. **Which of the following statements about Python sets is true?**

   * A) Sets are ordered collections.
   * B) Sets can contain duplicate elements.
   * C) Sets are immutable.
   * D) Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

   **Answer**: D) Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

3. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```python
   x = [i for i in range(5)]
   y = x
   y.append(5)
   print(x)
   ```



* A) \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
* B) \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
* C) \[5]
* D) Error

**Answer**: B) \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Explanation**: `y` references the same list as `x`, so changes to `y` affect `x`.
